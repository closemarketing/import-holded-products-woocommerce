Imports Products and data from Holded software to WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to import simple products from Holded to WooCommerce. 

It creates a new menu in WooCommerce > Products > Import products from Holded.

You can import simple products, and it will create new products if it does not find the SKU code from your WooCommerce. If the SKU exists, it will import all data except title and description from the product. The stock will be imported as well.

Â¡We have a Premium version!
These are the features:
- Import categories from Holded.
- Import attributes as brands or others.
- Import variable products.
- Automate the syncronization.
